Hi all, very long-time no post, I'm back with a new series. I've been thinking about this for a while and I think it's time to share with you all.

As you know, my dream is to be an entrepreneur and I've been working on a few side-projects in the past. But, you know, starting a business is hard, especially when you're doing it alone. I've been struggling with this for a while, I nearly burnt out. But, I'm not giving up and now, with the new idea, I decided to start a new project. And I want to build it in public. Inspired by [a series of Luca Netz ( CEO of Pudgy Penguins)](https://www.youtube.com/@lucanetzofficial/playlists), I watched his videos on YouTube, and I think it's so great to share with the community about the journey of building a product.

## Dream
You know, I'm currently working as a blockchain engineer in a one of the biggest company in VietNam, and I'm so grateful for that. But, the dream is still there, I want to build my own product. I decided to start this project beside my full-time job at the company. You know, starting a business is hard, and I don't want to quit my job to start a business. Maybe it will make the journey harder and slower, but I think it's worth it. Full-time job will help me to pay the bills and this project will help me to learn and grow.

This project will be build in my free time, after work, on weekends, and holidays. Try to balance between work and life, and I hope I can make it.

## Team-up
After few failed projects, I realized that the good team is the key to success, the most valuable asset of a startup. I can't do it alone, I need a team. My friends, Miên and Phát, are also sharing the same dream with me. They have worked with me on a few projects before. Don't like other teams, we start this journey before having any ideas (LOL), but we know that we have the same vision and dream that make the world better.

About Miên, he has been my friend for 5 years, he is a mobile developer, me and him have been working together in the graduated project, and we have a good relationship. He is a good developer, and he has a lot of experience in mobile development. He is a good fit for the team.

About Phát, he is a backend developer, he is friend of Miên, and he has been working with us in the past. Now, he is studying in master degree. He is a good developer, and he has a lot of experience in backend development. He is a good fit for the team.

So our team has 3 members, me as a blockchain engineer, Miên as a mobile developer, and Phát as a backend developer. I know that we are not perfect, none of us have experience in marketing, sales or product management. But at least, we share the same vision and dream, and we can learn and grow together.

## The idea
### Should we build something that really hit product-market fit?
We have been thinking about this for a while, and you know, we realized that we shouldn't build something that everyone agrees with. If the idea is universally accepted, the market is already saturated. We need to find a niche, a small group of people who really need our product.

Competing with a thousand of players in the market is impossible. We're just a small team, no fund, no experience, no network. We need to find a small group of people who really need our product, and we can make them happy.

### Why web3?
We have been working in the blockchain industry for a while, and we see the potential of web3. We believe that web3 will change the world, and we want to be a part of it. The growth of web3 is really fast, and we see a lot of opportunities here. We want to build something that can help people on web3, we think it's a good start.

### The problem
Web3 is great, but still have a lot of issues. One of them is the privacy, but the difficult thing is that people don't really care about privacy. They know that every action they make on-chain is being tracked, but they don't care. But somewhere, there are still people who really care about it, that why Tornado Cash is so popular. But Tornado Cash is not easy to use. Even me as a blockchain engineer, I still have to spend a lot of time to be comfortable with it. I care about privacy, but I don't want to use Tornado Cash it's require a lot of effort. That's the problem we want to solve.

We target to to build something that can help people to protect their privacy on web3, but it should be easy to use, and it should be for everyone.

### The idea
Vitalik's blog inspired us to build this idea. I read his blog about [Stealth Address](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/01/20/stealth.html), it's awesome and I think it's a good start for us. Although this idea is still have a lot of problems, but we choose to go with it. 

Our target is bring stealth address to the blockchain wallet, make it easy to use, and make it for everyone. 

People can use our wallet application to send and receive crypto privately without any effort. The idea of stealth address is very simple, each address is generated for each transaction, and only the sender and receiver know about it.

We target on the small problem with simple solution, it's can help us to build the product faster and easier, suitable for our small team.

## Next steps
This is the very first post of the series, I will share with you all about the journey of building this product. Maybe it will be a success, maybe it will be a failure, but I think it's worth to share with you all.

Hope we can go far with this project, I know it's hard, I know it's risky. But our dream is still there. So many time I ask myself:

> "Why do I do this?, I can just live a normal life, money from investment is enough for me, why do I have to do this?". 

But the answer is still there, I want to build something that can make the world better, I want to build something that can help people, I want to build something that can make me proud. And I think it's worth it.

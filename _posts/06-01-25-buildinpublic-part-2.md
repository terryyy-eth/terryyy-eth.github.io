GmGm, I'm back with the second post of the series. In the last post, I shared with you all about the dream, team-up, and the idea. This post is the next step after we have the idea, market research, we need to do it to make sure that our idea is feasible and figure out how to build it.

## Market research
Actually, this part is hard, my team doesn't have any experience in market research.
